# Where are the robots

## Description

Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

## Solution

Hint shows"What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?" It means a text file called robots.txt that limits the crawler. When we typed robots.text on the website "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/robots.txt", the following message come out.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /1bb4c.html
```
​If you put that/1bb4c.html directly under the original URL like "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/
​56830/1bb4c.html", the flag will be displayed.
